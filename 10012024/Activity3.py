#You can use a loop to continuously prompt the user for input until a valid floating-point value is provided. Here's an example in Python:

while True:
    try:
        transfer_cash_amount = float(input("Enter the amount you want to transfer: "))
        break  # Exit the loop if a valid floating-point value is entered
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid floating-point number.")

# Now you can use the transfer_cash_amount variable for further processing
print("You entered:", transfer_cash_amount)

#In this code:

#The while True loop ensures that the program keeps prompting the user until a valid floating-point value is entered.
#The try block attempts to convert the user input to a float using float(input(...)).
#If a ValueError occurs (i.e., the user enters something that cannot be converted to a float), the except block is executed, and a message is printed asking the user to enter a valid floating-point number.
#If the conversion is successful, the loop is exited with the break statement, and you can proceed with further processing using the transfer_cash_amount variable.
