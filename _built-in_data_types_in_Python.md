Numeric Types:

Integers (int): Whole numbers without a decimal point (e.g., 5, -10).
Floats (float): Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form (e.g., 3.14, 2.5e2).
Text Type:

Strings (str): Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., 'hello', "world").
Sequence Types:

Lists (list): Ordered, mutable collections of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
Tuples (tuple): Ordered, immutable collections of items (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
Mapping Type:

Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs (e.g., {'key': 'value', 'number': 42}).
Set Types:

Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
Boolean Type:

Booleans (bool): Represents either True or False.
None Type:

NoneType (None): Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
Binary Types:

Bytes (bytes): Represents a sequence of bytes.
Bytearrays (bytearray): Mutable version of bytes.
Range Type:

Ranges (range): Represents a sequence of numbers.
Remember that Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter infers it based on the value assigned to the variable. Enjoy learning Python!


The list I provided covers the most commonly used built-in data types in Python. However, Python is an extensible language, and there are some additional modules and types available, but they may not be as fundamental or widely used as the ones mentioned earlier. Here are a couple more:

Decimal:

Decimal (decimal.Decimal): Represents fixed-point and floating-point numbers accurately. Useful for financial and precise arithmetic.
Complex:

Complex (complex): Represents complex numbers with a real and an imaginary part (e.g., 3 + 2j).
These are more specialized data types, and their usage depends on specific needs. The ones listed in my previous responses cover the essentials you'll encounter in everyday Python programming.
